# Golang code Katas

## About
This repository is inspired by Jeffrey Way's [PHP laracasts series](https://laracasts.com/series/code-katas-in-php). 
Can not describe it better than Jeffrey said 

>If martial artists use kata as a method for exercise 
and practice, what might be the equivalent for coders, 
like us? Well, code katas are short, repeatable 
programming challenges, which are meant to exercise 
everything from your focus, to your workflow.

The main idea of this repository, is to understand the basics of Unit Testing in Golang.
May be it will be useful for other in future, who will try 
to understand all techniques of testing.
